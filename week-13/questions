1) Enterococcus faecalis is the most dominant microbiota. It exapnds over and then goes down. Staphylococcus epidermidis abundance increases as time goes on. 

2) We can group contigs by GC content and read abundance and these are species specific. Can also group them by kmer profiles.

4) We could compare the Kraken classifications in a bin for all the assembled contigs and not just a single contig. Then choose the highest frequency contigs.

5) The heatmap confirms the trends in the taxonomy distributions.
